The JS code has been drafted. Going forward I will work to solve the following issues:
- Code is long and repetitive. I might want to consider moving away from else if statements or implement more functions to handle repeated tasks
- My solution for players making their choice in capital letters isn't working, though because I accounted for invalid choices already this doesn't crash the program.

The first issue has been eased to an extent. Although I wouldn't call it well-written code, I'm happy with its readability for the time being.
